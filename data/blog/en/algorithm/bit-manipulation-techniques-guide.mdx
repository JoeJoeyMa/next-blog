### Basics - True Form, Ones' Complement, Two's Complement

As we all know, the most fundamental element in computer programs is binary. Here are three types of codes you must understand about binary:

- **True Form**: The first bit is the sign bit, where 1 represents negative and 0 represents positive; **The ones' complement and two's complement of positive numbers are the same as their true form**
- **Ones' Complement**: For negative numbers, the sign bit is 1, and all other bits are inverted (0->1, 1->0)
- **Two's Complement**: For negative numbers, it's their ones' complement + 1

**The principle of two's complement is *modular congruence***. Recommended reading: [Computer Organization - True Form, Ones' Complement, Two's Complement](https://www.cnblogs.com/banmei-brandy/p/12299655.html). **Integers exist in computers as two's complement** because it makes negative number calculations easier.

### Bit Operations

- `&`, AND: results in 0 if any bit is 0
- `|`, OR: results in 1 if any bit is 1
- `~`, NOT: inverts all bits. Its decimal mathematical calculation is `add 1 and invert`
- `^`, XOR: results in 0 if bits are the same, 1 if different
- `x >> n`, right shift: discards low bits, fills high bits with sign bit. Its decimal mathematical calculation is `x / 2^n`
- `x << n`, left shift: discards high bits, fills low bits with 0. Its decimal mathematical calculation is `x * 2^n`

### Common Techniques

In the following, `x` represents a number

- Check if odd/even: `x & 1 ? odd : even`
- Round towards zero[^1]: `x | 0`
- Check indexOf result: `!~x`, only when `x` is `-1`, `~x` equals 0, you can think of it as `!(not)~(exists)x`
- Convert boolean to 0/1: `~~x`, true -> 1, false -> 0
- Middle value: `x >> 1`
- Check if numbers have opposite signs: `(x ^ y) < 0` means opposite signs. The advantage over using multiplication is no integer overflow.
  Note that bit operations have lower precedence than arithmetic operations, so remember to add parentheses when combining them.

### Advanced Techniques

- `x & x - 1`, eliminates the last 1 in x's binary representation.
  - Can be used to solve lc.191 Hamming Weight, lc.461 Hamming Distance, lc.231 Power of Two
- `x & -x`, gets the value represented by the last 1 in x.
  - In React source code, `getHighestPriorityLane` uses this to get the highest priority (React defines 1 as higher priority the more right it is).
- `x ^ x === 0; x ^ 0 === x`, and XOR operation satisfies commutative and associative laws.

Let's look at a classic problem: _In a set of numbers, only 2 numbers appear once, while others appear an even number of times. Find these 2 numbers._

```js
// test: [1,2,3,4,5,6,5,4,3,2]
function findOnlyOne(arr) {
  let val = 0
  for (const item of arr) {
    val ^= item
  }
  // At this point, val is the XOR result of the two numbers that appear only once
  // Based on XOR properties (same bits = 0, different bits = 1), two different numbers XORed will have at least one 1
  // We can find the rightmost 1
  const rightOne = val & -val

  let a = 0
  for (const item of arr) {
    // rightOne can divide the original data into two groups, thus separating the first different number
    if ((rightOne & item) === 0) {
      a ^= item
    }
  }
  let b = a ^ val // Using XOR property: if a ^ b = c, then a ^ c = b
  return [a, b]
}
```

In some source code, binary is often used to define constants, and bit operations are used for processing:

```js
const A = 1 << 0; // 0b00000001
const B = 1 << 1; // 0b00000010
const C = 1 << 2; // 0b00000100

const ABC = A | B | C; // 0b00000111 add properties
const AB = ABC & ~C;   // 0b00000011 remove properties
(AB & B) === B         // true, means AB contains B
(AB & C) === 0         // true, means AB doesn't contain C
```

[^1]: Rounding towards zero means rounding down for positive numbers and rounding up for negative numbers. From a number line perspective, it means rounding towards zero from both sides.
