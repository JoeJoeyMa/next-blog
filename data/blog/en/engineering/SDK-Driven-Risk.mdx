## I. Project Background

Commercial risk control systems are often expensive and lack customization capabilities, making it difficult to respond quickly to evolving business risk mitigation requirements. Development teams need simple, easy-to-use tools (SDKs) for seamless integration of risk control capabilities, while risk control and operations teams require an intuitive, efficient platform for strategy management and optimization. There is a significant gap between these two needs.

## II. Core Design Principles

1. **Dual-Mode Architecture (Inline + Bypass)**: Supports both **"Inline (Synchronous)"** and **"Bypass (Asynchronous)"** modes. This enables millisecond-level real-time risk decisions for critical operations like transactions and logins, while also supporting non-blocking background analysis and risk accumulation calculations for user behavior and content.

2. **Modularity and Extensibility**: The system adopts a microservices or modular architecture. Components (event ingestion, rule engine, data storage, admin dashboard, etc.) have clear responsibilities and low coupling, making them easy to upgrade, extend, and maintain independently.

3. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Emphasizes the value of data by not only storing risk events but also focusing on risk feature extraction and application. Supports fine-grained strategies based on rich contextual data, laying the foundation for future machine learning model integration.

4. **Ultimate User Experience**: Provides developers with concise, standardized SDKs while offering risk control/operations teams a visual, process-oriented strategy management platform, reducing barriers to entry and improving work efficiency.

## III. System Architecture Overview

The system is logically divided into the following core layers:

      return await response.json();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Risk check failed:', error);
      return { status: 'error', code: 500 };
    }
  }

  // Asynchronous event reporting
  async report(event: RiskEvent): Promise<void> {
    this.queue.push(event);
    if (this.queue.length >= 10) {
      await this.flush();
    }
  }

  private async flush(): Promise<void> {
    if (this.queue.length === 0) return;
    
    const events = [...this.queue];
    this.queue = [];

    try {

* **Strategy Lifecycle**: Provides complete strategy creation, simulation, testing (shadow mode), grayscale, deployment, monitoring, and retirement process management.
* **Model Integration**: Reserved interfaces for future easy integration of internal or third-party machine learning models (such as fraud scoring, anomaly detection models), enabling hybrid decision-making between rules and models.
* **Risk Loss Reduction**: Effectively reduces direct economic losses from fraud and abuse through more accurate, real-time risk identification and handling.
* **Development Experience Optimization**: Standardized SDKs significantly reduce business integration costs, letting developers focus on business logic.
* **Data-Driven Growth**: Risk data accumulated not only serves risk control but also feeds back to business, used for user profiling, reputation assessment, etc., empowering business growth.

```typescript
// 1. Batch reporting optimization
const batchReporter = new BatchReporter({
  maxBatchSize: 50,
  maxWaitTime: 2000,
  retryStrategy: exponentialBackoff({
    maxRetries: 3,
    initialDelay: 1000
  })
});

// 2. Feature data local caching
const featureCache = new LRUCache({
  max: 1000,
  maxAge: 1000 * 60 * 5 // 5 minutes
});

// 3. WebWorker for complex computation
const riskWorker = new Worker('risk-worker.js');
riskWorker.postMessage({
  type: 'COMPUTE_DEVICE_FINGERPRINT',
  payload: deviceInfo
});
```

## VI. Future Roadmap

* **Intelligence Enhancement**: Deep integration of machine learning capabilities for automated risk scoring, anomaly detection, and strategy recommendations.
* **Strategy A/B Testing Platform**: More scientific evaluation of different strategy effects.
* **Visual Correlation Analysis**: Help analysts discover risk patterns and groups more intuitively.
* **Cross-System Integration**: Strengthen integration with other internal systems (like CRM, credit review) to build a more comprehensive risk view.
