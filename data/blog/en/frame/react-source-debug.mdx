Why am I writing this article? Because I wanted to debug React source code using a project based on `vite` rather than one created with `cra`. I couldn't find this combination online, so I decided to do it myself. As a result, I encountered some pitfalls, which I must record. Who knows, it might help someone else 😄.

## Download the Source Code

The target is React version `v18.2.0`. Simply download the corresponding tag. [^1]

```sh
g cloneb v18.2.0 https://github.com/facebook/react.git
```

## Install Dependencies

When installing dependencies, you're likely to encounter the following issues 🐞:

- `gifsicle: Command failed`, because React's dependencies rely on the `autoconf` package. First, use `homebrew` to install it (for macOS, I'm not sure about Windows)
    ```sh
    brew install autoconf automake libtool
    ```
- `electron: Command failed`, an Electron mirror source issue. You need to set a usable mirror source. The Taobao mirror found online is outdated (I couldn't find the latest one), but I discovered that Huawei's works well
    ```sh
    yarn config set electron_mirror https://mirrors.huaweicloud.com/electron/
    ```

## Compilation Preparation

We need to modify the packaging configuration `react/scripts/rollup/build.js/getRollupOutputOptions`. First, enable `sourcemap` for easy source code tracking, and second, comment out several plugins to prevent compilation errors:

```ts
// Core: source code mapping
sourcemap: true
// Comment out the following plugins, otherwise compilation will throw errors
// 1. transform removes 'use strict' from files
// 2. closure compresses code in production environment
// 3. prettier formats and beautifies
// 4. renderChunk adds header code like license
// 5. stripUnusedImports removes unused imports
```

## Start Compilation

```sh
yarn build --type=NODE
# Of course, you can choose to compile only these parts
yarn build react/index,react/jsx,react-dom/index,scheduler --type=NODE
```

After compilation, create global symlinks for use in later projects. Enter the `build/react` and `build/react-dom` directories respectively:
```sh
pnpm link -g
# View the global symlinks created by pnpm
pnpm list -g --depth 0
```

## Link to Project

I created the project using `@twotwoba/mk-app-cli`[^2]. Before using `pnpm link` to import the compiled `react` and `react-dom` into the project, first modify the project configuration:
- `package.json`
    ```diff
    {
        "dependencies": {
    -    "react": "^18.2.0",
    -    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
        }
    }
    ```

- `vite.config.ts`
    ```diff
    build: {
        rollupOptions: {
    +       external: ['react', 'react-dom']
            output: {
    +            globals: {
    +                react: 'React',
    +                'react-dom': 'ReactDOM'
    +            }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

After installing the dependencies for the project, use pnpm to reference the global symlinks:
```sh
pnpm i
pnpm link -g react react-dom
```

## Start Debug Mode

For details, see [VSCode official debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging). I won't elaborate further.

1. First, start the project `pnpm run dev`
2. Enter VSCode's debug panel, create `launch.json`, as follows:
    ```json
    {
        "type": "chrome",
        "request": "launch",
        "name": "Debug React Source Code",
        "url": "http://localhost:7788", // Configure the port according to your project
        "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}"
    }
    ```
    After configuration, press `F5` or click the start button to enter debug mode. Then you can freely set breakpoints in VSCode and trace the source code according to the call stack 😄.

## Icing on the Cake

Actually, with the above steps, you can already debug React source code smoothly in VSCode, but there are two shortcomings:
1. The source code file located through the call stack is not the React source file we cloned
2. You can't add bookmarks 🔖 using the `Bookmarks` plugin in the located source code

To solve these two problems, we need to make slight modifications to the above steps.

- Put the cloned `React source code` and the `project used for debugging` in the same folder. The purpose of this is to make them in the same `workspace`
- In this directory, create a new `launch.json`, modify as follows
   ```diff
   {
   -     "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}"
   +     "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}/YourProject"
   }
   ```

Finally, let's start the project again and open debug mode. If all goes well, when you click on the call stack, you can directly locate the React source code file. Great job 🎉

> The principle is simple: as long as the sourcemap is effective and the mapped file is under the current workspace, VSCode will open the corresponding file
